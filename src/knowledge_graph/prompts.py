For each group:
1. Identify sets of TRUE synonyms (keywords that refer to the EXACT same concept and \
are fully interchangeable word-for-word in any sentence without changing meaning). \
Topical relatedness, part-whole relationships, abbreviation-expansion pairs with \
different scope, and general-vs-specific pairs do NOT qualify. When in doubt, keep them separate.
2. Choose the best canonical label, prefer the form used in academic/textbook literature.
3. List keywords that are NOT synonymous with any other keyword as standalone.
Respond in JSON only:
